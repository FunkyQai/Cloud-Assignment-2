# Quiz Generator

## Description:
This project is a Quiz Generator API designed for CZ4052 Assignment 2. It utilizes GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Langchain (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technologies to generate quiz questions. The API is built using the Flask framework.

## Instructions:

1. **Download Dependencies:**
   Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```Bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Flask App:**
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Flask app (`main.py`). This will start the server, allowing you to access the generated quiz questions. You can run the app using the following command:
   ```Bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Access Generated Quiz Questions:**
After running the Flask app, the generated quiz question will be displayed in the browser.

## Note:
This project serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate how a Quiz Generator API can be built on Google Cloud Run. It showcases the integration of advanced language technologies like GPT and Langchain for generating quiz questions. The sample document used for this generator is the CZ4052 Virtualization lecture slides, but the system can be adapted to work with various other documents or sources.
